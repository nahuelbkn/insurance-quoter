# Insurance Quoter

#### This website simulates the calculation of the price of a vehicle insurance based on three data, the origin of the vehicle (domestic or imported manufacture), the year of manufacture and the type of coverage desired (basic or complete).

Values are fictitious and, starting at a base of $2000, vary as follows:

#### Origin:
If the vehicle is imported, the cost increases by 25% (on the base value).

#### Year:
If the vehicle is national, a 3% discount is made (on the base value) for each year of antiquity, but if it is imported there is an increase of 3% for each year of antiquity.

#### Coverage:
If full coverage is chosen, an increase of 35% is made (on the base value).
